              <h2>Educational Background:</h2>
              <p class="maxwidth"> I am currently a student at the University of Surrey at the <em>Msc Program Digital Marketing and Channel Management</em> and attending online seminars, provided by Google and HubSpot to enrich my knowledges and skills within the topic of Digital Marketing. I have graduated from Cyprus University of  Technology from the <em>Bsc Program Communications and Internet Studies</em>. <br>
              Finally, I have been a student at Archibishop Makarios iii Lyceum in Nicosia.</p>

              <h3>Take Aways from works</h3>
                <p class="maxwidth">During all my working expriences I understood the importance of respect and personalities. Everyone is different and should be treated differently. This highly relates to my marketing career that I plan to follow as each customer is unique with preferences and wishes to be satisfied or even to be approached. As an individual, I can adapt to any given task as long as I am given a clear guidance on the goals and the objectives either sales, customer exprience or improving the customer journey.</p>

          <h3>Gaming Marketing</h3>
          <p class="GamingDesc">I have passion for video-gaming. However, during the last years within the gaming industry, many companies have lost their value and loyalty from their customers. This is because of the wrong approach that the gaming industry is marching towards.</p>
